# TrueCert: A Decentralized Certificate Issuing and Verification System

TrueCert is a decentralized application (dApp) for issuing and verifying certificates securely and transparently using blockchain technology and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This project aims to simplify the process of issuing and verifying certificates while ensuring immutability and accessibility.

## Features

- **Certificate Issuance**: Generate unique certificates with metadata such as student name, position of responsibility, society, and issue date.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Store certificate data securely on IPFS to ensure immutability and global accessibility.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Record certificate hashes on the blockchain for tamper-proof verification.
- **RESTful API**: Issue and retrieve certificates via an API.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (or compatible network)
- **Storage**: IPFS
- **Frontend**: (Optional, for UI) React.js
